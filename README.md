Maternal health remains a critical concern worldwide, with various risk factors impacting the well-being of expectant mothers. This project focuses on developing a predictive model for maternal health risk assessment using machine learning techniques, specifically leveraging the Random Forest algorithm. The study incorporates essential parameters such as maternal age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), blood sugar levels, temperature, and heartbeat to discern potential health risks during pregnancy.

The dataset utilized in this study comprises comprehensive maternal health records collected from diverse demographics. Through meticulous data preprocessing, feature selection, and engineering techniques, we ensure the integrity and relevance of input parameters for the predictive model. Random Forest, a robust ensemble learning method, is employed due to its ability to handle complex interactions and nonlinear relationships within the data.

The predictive model undergoes rigorous training and validation processes to optimize performance and generalizability. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are utilized to assess the model's predictive capabilities. Additionally, techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance model robustness and mitigate overfitting.

The developed predictive model demonstrates promising results in maternal health risk prediction, providing healthcare practitioners with valuable insights into potential complications during pregnancy. By identifying high-risk cases early, healthcare interventions can be tailored to mitigate adverse outcomes and improve maternal and fetal well-being. The integration of machine learning techniques in maternal health risk management signifies a significant stride towards personalized and proactive healthcare delivery for expectantÂ mothers.
